			<h2>Januaury 18, 2021: Personal Record on Cal of Duty Warzone</h2>
			<img class ="floated" src="warzone_image.jpg">
			<p class="special">Today I got the highest score I have ever received in Call of Duty Warzone. I usually average around 7-8 kills per game but today was different. Today I actually got 22. I will admit that the players I was going against may not have been the best players in the world but getting 22 is definitely still very impressive. I was not able to carry my team to a victory, but it was a very impressive achievement to me. Hopefully I have many more games like the one I had today.

			<h2>August 1, 2021: Becoming a legend in NBA2k21</h2>
			<img class ="floated" src="nba2k21_image.jpg">
			<p class = "special">I finally did it. I finally reached the ultimate goal in NBA2k21. I am offically a legend, which is the highest rep you can reach in the game. It took months to get here but I am finally here. I can finally get all the special perks of being a legend and not only that, I get my own custom entrance whenever I load into a server now. I spent a lot of time on this game, probably a lot more than I should have, but at least I reached my goal that I planned to hit when the game released. Can not wait to show off to all my friends.
